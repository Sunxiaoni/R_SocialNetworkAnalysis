# R_SocialNetworkAnalysis

Social network analysis (SNA) is the process of investigating social structures and reslationship through the use of networks and graph theory. 
It identifies and demonstrates networked structures in terms of nodes (individual actors, people, or things within the network) and 
the ties, edges, or links (relationships or interactions) that connect them.

Trough network analysis, it helps us to understand, predict better the network among the group and features.

Here, I will share the implementation for 2 practices of social network analysis in R and the result of UCINET.
